// TODOs:
// can't fix slow scrolling not snapping because the spec doesn't define it, also firefox tends to have issues with scrolling to nearest
// need to make it accept array inputs with JSON of [{URL: uri, Alt_text: alt}] and then split to proper parts
// need to add overlay (?onclick) controls maximise thing to see the content larger (when you click on images)
// fix slider starting off slightly too far right on load in mobile device -- not that important but can be seen if there is a background colour and it's rounded borders (appears to be from margin on left when initially loading page)
// fix nav buttons being slow and causing re-renders (maybe from onclick doing triggering function any times)
// fix highlighting styling on last element in list
// fix the way the nav button spread to edge of container when not constrained (due to .slides class having 100% width instead of just width of single image)
// fix snap-scrolling not workking anymore
